# Homework — Product Experiments (Spotify)

## Part 1: User Journey

I first started using **Spotify** in 2018, after switching from another music app.  
The journey went something like this:

1. **Onboarding (2018)**  
   - Simple sign-up with Google.  
   - Instant access to curated playlists like “Discover Weekly” and “Release Radar.”  
   - The personalization right from the start made me feel “at home.”

2. **Early Use (2019–2020)**  
   - Began creating my own playlists.  
   - Loved the cross-device syncing — seamless switch between mobile, desktop, and smart speakers.  
   - Shared playlists with friends; Spotify became social.  

3. **Current Use (2021–Present)**  
   - Heavy reliance on personalized recommendations.  
   - Daily use for workouts, focus sessions, and commuting.  
   - Podcasts integrated into Spotify — now it’s my **all-in-one audio hub.**  
   - Use Wrapped at the end of the year as a fun, engaging recap.  

**Things I loved most:**  
- Personalization (recommendations that get better over time).  
- Cross-device continuity (picking up music where I left off).  
- Social aspects (collaborative playlists, Wrapped, sharing).

## Part 2: Experiments

### Experiment 1: “Smart Playlist Auto-Renewal”
**Idea:** Instead of static playlists, give users the option to have a playlist auto-refresh weekly with similar songs.  

- **Allocation:**  
  - **Control (50%)**: Standard Spotify experience (static playlists).  
  - **Treatment (50%)**: Users can toggle “Auto-Renew” on any playlist.  

- **Hypothesis:**  
  - **Leading metrics**: Increase in number of playlist plays, skips per session, and active minutes.  
  - **Lagging metrics**: Retention (monthly active users), subscription conversion (free → premium).

### Experiment 2: “AI DJ Mood Customization”
**Idea:** Extend Spotify’s DJ feature with more granular mood controls (e.g., “chill focus,” “hype workout,” “rainy night vibes”).  

- **Allocation:**  
  - **Control (40%)**: Standard Spotify DJ experience.  
  - **Treatment A (30%)**: DJ with simple mood presets (focus, workout, relax).  
  - **Treatment B (30%)**: DJ with granular controls (energy, tempo, genre blends).  

- **Hypothesis:**  
  - **Leading metrics**: Increase in skips-to-play ratio, session length, interaction with DJ.  
  - **Lagging metrics**: Premium retention, NPS (user satisfaction).

### Experiment 3: “Friends Listening Feed”
**Idea:** A TikTok-style vertical feed showing what friends are currently listening to, with quick tap-to-play.  

- **Allocation:**  
  - **Control (50%)**: No feed.  
  - **Treatment (50%)**: Feed available as a tab in the app.  

- **Hypothesis:**  
  - **Leading metrics**: Higher shares per user, increase in follows, feed scroll depth.  
  - **Lagging metrics**: Engagement frequency (DAU/WAU ratio), viral growth via invites.
